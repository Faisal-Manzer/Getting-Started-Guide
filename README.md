# Productive Summer
Students who are willing to start something this summer.  

## Mindset
Go through these basic tutorials and all courses. The Numbered bullets should be followed in sequence,
whereas unordered bullets can be done randomly.  
The thing will get easy with practice always start is hard. My suggestion is that go through the documentation tutorial first, then try video playlist. It will help you to understand better.  
Some concepts will be entirely new and can be very hard to understand, give a tough fight try to understand one time two time five time but don't leave.  

**What to start?**: Just start with anything at the end of the day will learn some logic building and will learn something which will surely stay with you. You can switch domains afterwards when you find your interest.  
**Documentation tutorial is hard to understand**: yes, I know that you will face this. The reason why I am pushing for documentation tutorials is that you need to learn how to read the documentation. When you will do a real project, reading will be the main key. **Copy Paste, Try to understand what is going on. Not understanding is completely fine, you will understand with videos when the creator will explain things.**

**Disclaimer**: I am no a guru of anything, I took some of these courses, I included some creators that I love, some just came on a random search.
This is not a combination of the greatest courses these are normal courses. I am affiliated with any one of them.  

#### I AM WAITING FOR YOUR PR, PLEASE.

## Web Development
These are more than concepts and understanding terminologies. Backend generally needs critical thinking, logic building, and connecting things.
1. [How web works](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RsQ1tFLwldY)
2. [HTTP Request and Resonse](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sxiRFwQ1RJ4&t=21s)
3. [What is Rest API](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qVTAB8Z2VmA)

### Frontend development
The workflow that I will suggest that do [Basic](#basic-needed-for-all) and then move to [React](#react) (because that is easy to start with) then come to [Basic Level 2](#basic-level-2). You will learn some things on the fly. Just dedicate time, and stay with problems. First, try to go with documentation tutorials and then move to video tutorials. Try some projects other than that of tutorials.

#### Basic [Needed for all]
1. [HTML](https://www.w3schools.com/html/default.asp): The skeleton
2. [CSS](https://www.w3schools.com/css/default.asp): The beauty
3. [JS Basic](https://www.w3schools.com/js/default.asp): The logic

This is a basic portion for anyone interested in frontend development. I guess a good read for HTML, seeing some examples of CSS and trying some of JS will do. Don't get stuck here for long.

#### React
**A JavaScript library for building user interfaces.**  
React is powerful yet simple, you need to learn only concepts and then it is super easy to use.

1. [Get started with documentation](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QFaFIcGhPoM&list=PLC3y8-rFHvwgg3vaYJgHGnModB54rxOk3)
2. [Get started with videos](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WDvn0w86itw&list=PLYxzS__5yYQmD7FV1YYz9UxPyGTNsFObp)
3. Project: ToDo Application

**React does only one thing that is building user interfaces.** For other thing need for a full-fledged application you need to dig into its ecosystem.

Important concepts to learn:
1. [State and Props](https://stackoverflow.com/questions/27991366/what-is-the-difference-between-state-and-props-in-react)
2. [Component Lifecycle](https://hackernoon.com/reactjs-component-lifecycle-methods-a-deep-dive-38275d9d13c0)
3. Creating Reusable Components
4. [JSX](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7fPXI_MnBOY)

Some Advanced concepts:
1. [Redux](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=np8A_aW7Pew)
2. [React with Redux](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7bMTJxvEJiE&list=PL55RiY5tL51rrC3sh8qLiYHqUV3twEYU_&index=4)
3. [Routers](https://github.com/ReactTraining/react-router)
4. [Axios](https://github.com/axios/axios): Although this has nothing to do with react but is very frequently used.

#### Angular
1. [Get started with documentation](https://angular.io/tutorial)
2. [Get started with videos](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0eWrpsCLMJQ&list=PLC3y8-rFHvwhBRAgFinJR8KHIrCdTkZcZ)

I haven't worked with angular yet, I would love for your pull request.

#### Basic Level 2
Now JavaScript generally means combined with node.

- [ES6](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qYk4N6kNups&list=PLYxzS__5yYQkoBSq0lA2fNWzN_O8efTMF&index=2&t=0s)
- [npm](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6fj0cpmMiVg&list=PLC3y8-rFHvwhgWwm5J3KqzX47n7dwWNrq)
- [Javascript ES6](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dlfrWbYk1v0&list=PLRAV69dS1uWTSu9cVg8jjXW8jndOYYJPP&index=1): The creator is a bit slow and the course is lengthy but is worthy.

#### Design Concepts
This is UI/UX part of an application. Frontend applications are not only for working they should look good.
- [Adobe XD](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_42MzdYbx2o&list=PLRAV69dS1uWSUAYohDFYhn24WgfnpzzNF)
- [Graphics Design](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aWf1LpUnYmU&list=PLpQQipWcxwt9U7qgyYkvNH3Mp8XHXCMmQ)
- [Design languages](https://design-languages.com/)

Designing is a large topic and require more experience than coding, see more and more design on [behance](https://www.behance.net), watch

### Backend Development
#### Flask
Flask is easy and simple, used for simple to more complex applications.

1. [Get started with documentation](http://flask.pocoo.org/docs/1.0/tutorial/)
2. [Get started with videos](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MwZwr5Tvyxo&list=PL-osiE80TeTs4UjLw5MM6OjgkjFeUxCYH)
3. [Rest api with flask](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PTZiDnuC86g)

#### Django
Django is powerful and very organised, get started with Django can be a little overwhelming, so I would suggest that first complete [Flask](#flask) tutorial and then try hands with Django (you can start with Django, no problem at all, but flask will help you understand the need and core concept of Django).

1. [Get Started with documentation](https://docs.djangoproject.com/en/2.2/intro/tutorial01/)
2. [Get started with videos](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qgGIqRFvFFk&list=PL6gx4Cwl9DGBlmzzFcLgDhKTTfNLfX1IK): Although this tutorial is in Django 1.9 core concepts remain same.
3. Project: Blog App

Django Rest Framework
1. [Get started with documentation](https://www.django-rest-framework.org/tutorial/quickstart/)
2. [Get Started with videos](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zRwy8gtgJ1A&list=PLillGF-RfqbbbPz6GSEM9hLQObuQjNoj_)

[Django Cookbook for advanced users](https://books.agiliq.com/en/latest/): You will need this when developing a real-world application

#### Express
1. [Get Started with documentation](https://expressjs.com/en/starter/installing.html)
2. [Get started with videos](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l2dKL2YrR1U&list=PLYxzS__5yYQmHbpKMARP04F344zYRX91I&index=14)
3. [Rest API with Express](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=o3ka5fYysBM)

## Cloud Computing and Security
### Get started with AWS
1. [Udemy Course AWS with Django](https://www.udemy.com/share/100nwIBEEbcldWQn4=/): Django only is at some part of the tutorial, I loved this course because it covers the whole architecture and is a great basic start.
2. [Understanding the Complex](https://www.udemy.com/share/10009iAEYceF9SQHQ=/): I haven't taken this course myself but going through syllabus it seems to be very much useful.
3. [AWS for developers](https://www.udemy.com/share/1000viAEYceF9SQHQ=/): This is great for start and also DevOps.
Take one of these 3 courses to go with, you will understand what to do next. All three courses are different in some way.

- [Server-less APIs](https://www.udemy.com/share/1001DoAEYceF9SQHQ=/)
### System design
I love [this](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=quLrc3PbuIw&list=PLMCXHnjXnTnvo6alSjVkgxV-VH6EPyvoX) tutorials for system design basics.

### Cyber Security and Ethical Hacking
- [Web bug bounty](https://courses.learncodeonline.in/learn/Ethical-Hacking-Master-Course-Web-Bug-Bounty-from-scratch?tab=1): This is good for a backend developer, I took this course and was basic and good I guess.
- [Ethical Hacking](https://www.udemy.com/share/1013kMAEYceF9SQHQ=/)

Take any of the two above course for getting started with basics. They have the same topics.

- [Basics of Cyber Security](https://www.udemy.com/share/1000AiAEYceF9SQHQ=/)
- [Network security](https://www.udemy.com/share/100240AEYceF9SQHQ=/)

## Machine Learning, AI, NLP
I don't know anything about Machine Learning, but generally, people start with [this](https://www.coursera.org/learn/machine-learning).

## App Development
### React Native
1. [Get Started with documentation](https://facebook.github.io/react-native/docs/getting-started)
2. [Get Started with Videos](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EMoXvr0Q9LE&list=PLYxzS__5yYQlHANFLwcsSzt3elIbYTG1h)

React Native can be frustrating while installing, I will highly recommend starting with **Expo**, which is under the tab `Expo CLI Quickstart` on page [Getting Started](https://facebook.github.io/react-native/docs/getting-started).

Read [why not expo](https://docs.expo.io/versions/v32.0.0/introduction/why-not-expo/) and if you feel so then use `React Native CLI`. Installation is given on tab `React Native CLI Quickstart`. **Follow the installation step by step and line by line**, do not skip or do anything else other than what is given, even do not try to mess with versions, just do what is said.  

React Native is not self-sufficient, it needs more modules for little advanced uses.
1. [Redux](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=np8A_aW7Pew)
2. [React Native with Redux](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KcC8KZ_Ga2M&list=PLy9JCsy2u97m3nSbw0xzo-X4EEoZiikd8)
3. [React Navigation V2](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eUIq0vzDdJQ&list=PLy9JCsy2u97nn0Yrf3ioMbRL7guVlzk9d)
4. [React Navigation V3](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MePfTc_PgzQ&list=PLy9JCsy2u97kiHGp2USF5SKAfz93WwLuh): First see V2 then jump to this
5. [Axios](https://github.com/axios/axios): Although this has nothing to do with react but is very frequently used.

### Flutter
1. [Get started with documentation](https://flutter.dev/docs/reference/tutorials)
2. [Get started with video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BDwCQc2uEfw&list=PLRAV69dS1uWT-ooTYHCqgxMTGA233JMrP)

### Android
- [Udacity Basic Course](https://classroom.udacity.com/courses/ud851)
Waiting for the PR.

### iOS
1. [Swift Tutorial](https://docs.swift.org/swift-book/GuidedTour/GuidedTour.html)
2. [official apple tutorial](https://developer.apple.com/library/archive/referencelibrary/GettingStarted/DevelopiOSAppsSwift/) is great to start with.
3. [Udacity Free course](https://classroom.udacity.com/courses/ud585)

## Technologies and Languages
### Git and GitHub
[This Udacity course is great](https://classroom.udacity.com/courses/ud775)
### Python
- [W3Schools](https://www.w3schools.com/python/default.asp)
- [Udemy Course](https://www.udemy.com/share/1000dOAEYceF9SQHQ=/): This course is best that I could find, but is lengthy. I recommend this to all level of students, beginners to advanced.
### Ruby
- [The Odin Project](https://www.theodinproject.com/courses/ruby-programming): This is probably the best Ruby course there is. It teaches Ruby using the concept of learning by doing (which, in my opinion, is the best way yo learn programming), i.e. you learn concepts by building projects using what you just learnt.
