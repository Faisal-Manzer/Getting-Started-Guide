# Getting Started Guide
For students who are willing to start something.  

## Mindset
Go through these basic tutorials and all courses. *The Numbered bullets should be followed in sequence, whereas unordered bullets can be done randomly*.  
The thing will get easy with practice always start is hard. My suggestion is that **`go through the official tutorial first, then try video playlist`**. It will help you to understand better.  
Some concepts will be entirely new and can be very hard to understand, give a tough fight try to understand one time two time five time but don't leave, you will understand things on the fly, Just dedicate time, and stay with problems.  

**What to start?**: Just start with anything at the end of the day will learn some logic building and will learn something which will surely stay with you. You can switch domains afterwards when you find your interest.  
**Official tutorial is hard to understand**: yes, I know that you will face this. The reason why I am pushing for documentation tutorials is that you need to learn how to read the documentation. When you will do a real project, reading will be the main key. **Copy Paste, Try to understand what is going on. Not understanding is completely fine, you will understand with videos when the creator will explain things.**

**Disclaimer**: I am no a guru of anything, I took some of these courses, I included some creators that I love, some just came on a random search.
This is not a combination of the greatest courses these are normal courses. I am not affiliated with any one of them.  

#### I AM WAITING FOR YOUR PR, PLEASE.

## Web Development
These are more than concepts and understanding terminologies. Backend generally needs critical thinking, logic building, and connecting things. Frontend needs designing, displaying and connecting things.
1. [How web works](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RsQ1tFLwldY)
2. [HTTP Request and Response](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sxiRFwQ1RJ4&t=21s)
3. [What is Rest API](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qVTAB8Z2VmA)
4. [The Web Developer Bootcamp] (https://www.udemy.com/course/the-web-developer-bootcamp/)

### Frontend development
The workflow that I will suggest that do [Basic](#basic-needed-for-all) and then move to [React](#react) (because that is easy to start with) then come to [Basic Level 2](#basic-level-2).

#### Basic [Needed for all]
1. [HTML](https://www.w3schools.com/html/default.asp): The skeleton
2. [CSS](https://www.w3schools.com/css/default.asp): The beauty
3. [JS Basic](https://www.w3schools.com/js/default.asp): The logic

This is a basic portion for anyone interested in frontend development. I guess a good read for HTML, seeing some examples of CSS and trying some of JS will do. Don't get stuck here for long. Alternativily you can try [The Web Developer Bootcamp](https://www.udemy.com/course/the-web-developer-bootcamp/) on udemy which is great.

#### React
**A JavaScript library for building user interfaces.**  
React is powerful yet simple, you need to learn only concepts and then it is super easy to use.

1. [Get started with official tutorial](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QFaFIcGhPoM&list=PLC3y8-rFHvwgg3vaYJgHGnModB54rxOk3)
2. [Get started with videos](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WDvn0w86itw&list=PLYxzS__5yYQmD7FV1YYz9UxPyGTNsFObp)
3. Project: ToDo Application

**React does only one thing that is building user interfaces.** For other thing need for a full-fledged application you need to dig into its ecosystem.

Important concepts to learn:
1. [State and Props](https://stackoverflow.com/questions/27991366/what-is-the-difference-between-state-and-props-in-react)
2. [Component Lifecycle](https://hackernoon.com/reactjs-component-lifecycle-methods-a-deep-dive-38275d9d13c0)
3. Creating Reusable Components
4. [JSX](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7fPXI_MnBOY)

Some Advanced concepts:
1. [Redux](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=np8A_aW7Pew)
2. [React with Redux](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7bMTJxvEJiE&list=PL55RiY5tL51rrC3sh8qLiYHqUV3twEYU_&index=4)
3. [Routers](https://github.com/ReactTraining/react-router)
4. [Axios](https://github.com/axios/axios): Although this has nothing to do with react but is very frequently used.

2. [Get started with videos](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MwZwr5Tvyxo&list=PL-osiE80TeTs4UjLw5MM6OjgkjFeUxCYH)
3. [Rest api with flask](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PTZiDnuC86g)

#### Django
Django is powerful and very organised, get started with Django can be a little overwhelming, so I would suggest that first complete [Flask](#flask) tutorial and then try hands with Django (you can start with Django, no problem at all, but flask will help you understand the need and core concept of Django).

1. [Get Started with official tutorial](https://docs.djangoproject.com/en/2.2/intro/tutorial01/)
2. [Get started with videos](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qgGIqRFvFFk&list=PL6gx4Cwl9DGBlmzzFcLgDhKTTfNLfX1IK): Although this tutorial is in Django 1.9 core concepts remain same.

#### Ruby on Rails
Ruby on Rails is the web framework that started it all. Launched over 13 years ago, it popularised web development and made it cool. It is a very powerful framework, that is incredibly easy to use and learn and can do anything you want it to. A lot of current popular frameworks like Django are inspired by Ruby on Rails.
1. [The Odin Project](https://www.theodinproject.com): This is the best course for learning Ruby on Rails, and is arguably the only course you'll need for it. It will teach you fullstack development in Ruby on Rails, i.e. backend, frontend, databases, testing and everything in between. You are basically empolyable after finishing this course.

#### PHP Backend
PHP is a widely-used open source general-purpose scripting language that is especially suited for web development and can be embedded into HTML.

## Download Guide
_THIS PORTION WAS COPIED FROM https://github.com/Faisal-Manzer/web-guide BY FAISAL MANZER_. 
If you are going to start web development you surely need tools.  
As for beginners, it is quite difficult to know all what why how to download.

- `Text Editors`
  web development is based on simple text files.  
  To just get a start you can use `notepad ( windows )` but is not effective and will create a hassle  

  - [Atom](https://atom.io/) **cross platform**.
  - [Sublime Text](https://www.sublimetext.com/3)  **cross platform**.
  
Text editor works at one file at a time they will also suggest you code but are not much powerful.

- `IDEs` : **beginners please you text editors** for some time. IDEs, unlike text editor, works on whole project or folder. They automatically compile codes and show advanced error and warning. IDEs are very powerful and will make you dependent on it. they are for the advanced user who has enough knowledge.

    - [Visual Studio Code](https://code.visualstudio.com/download) **FREE cross platform IDE** by Microsoft.
    - [WebStrom](https://www.jetbrains.com/webstorm/download) **cross platform** by JetBrains. **My favroite**.  
    **Free for students**.  [Register here](https://www.jetbrains.com/shop/eform/students) for avialing student discount. You just need _university ID Card_ or _university mail id_.
    - [PhpStrom](https://www.jetbrains.com/phpstorm/download/) specialized in PHP.  **cross platform** by JetBrains. **My favroite**.  
    **Free for students**.  [Register here](https://www.jetbrains.com/shop/eform/students) for avialing student discount. You just need _university ID Card_ or _university mail id_.
    
- `Browsers`
    - [Chrome](https://www.google.com/chrome/) USE CHROME AS DEFAULT DEVELOPMENT BROWSER. I would recommend using Chrome for web dev. It packs with best developer tools.
    - [FireFox](https://www.mozilla.org/en-US/firefox/new/) Second best option.

    All the below are not for development they are just for testing purpose. As a web developer, you need to test for the majority of cross browsers issue. Recommended to install all the browsers listed here.
    - [Opera](https://www.opera.com/download)
    - Edge - pre-installed on Windows
    - Internet Explorer -  pre-installed on Windows - yes you need this is want to cover all types of audience.
    - Safari  pre-installed on Mac

- `Server`: server is needed to run many things like PHP, Python, etc. They are needed for backend part.
    - `For Mac and Windows` [mamp](https://www.mamp.info/en/downloads/) **Recommended for basic use and will work out of box**
    Supports PHP, Python, Perl. Have inbuilt MySQL server. Supports both apache and nginx. 
    - `Linux, Windows, Mac` [lamp](https://bitnami.com/stack/lamp/installer) same specs as mamp.
    - `Windows` **wamp**. Download link not available. Sorry :) Search Google.
    - [xamp](https://www.apachefriends.org/download.html) **Cross-platform**, advanced

- `Technology`
    - [node.js](https://nodejs.org/en/download/) is a JavaScript runtime built on Chrome's V8 JavaScript engine. Node.js uses an event-driven, non-blocking I/O model that makes it lightweight and efficient. Node.js' package ecosystem, npm, is the largest ecosystem of open source libraries in the world.
    
    in simple words, node is just another server-side language which uses javascript as language and is async.

    - [Git](https://git-scm.com/downloads) git is a decentralized version control system which you will learn later. But for now, download it. Git runs on command line.

    Git has nothing to do with Web. It is for all languages or anything you want.
    - [Github desktop](https://desktop.github.com/) based on git there is a community called GitHub it gives space for repos online. ( there are more like BigBucket etc, but GitHub is most used and you should use it too ). 
    
    as git is a command line tool. Github Desktop provides a GUI for git. use when you are beginners but try to learn git command line as soon as possible. 
    
- `Image Editor` use the one you like. Simple image editor like [photoscape](https://photoscape.en.softonic.com/download) will do your task.

- `Chrome Extensions` yes they will help you lot.
    - [TabMan](https://chrome.google.com/webstore/detail/tabman-tabs-manager/hgmnkflcjcohihpdcniifjbafcdelhlm) is helpful when you will search lots and lots of stuff all in a new tab and now you are left with just favicon of the page. TabMan comes in rescue. I use it a lot.
    - [Chrome Web Server](https://chrome.google.com/webstore/detail/web-server-for-chrome/ofhbbkphhbklhfoeikjpcbhemlocgigb) a simple web server by Chrome.
    - [Grammerly](https://chrome.google.com/webstore/detail/grammarly-for-chrome/kbfnbcaeplbcioakkpcpgfkobkghlhen) is my love. it corrects all the spelling and grammatical mistakes in an article

## Data Structures and Algorithm
### Core Concepts
Core concept of Data structures are same for every language.
- [On Tutorials Point](https://www.tutorialspoint.com/data_structures_algorithms/): This is quite cool which covers the concepts with Pseudo-code.
### With Python
1. [Mit OCW](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HtSuA80QTyo&list=PLUl4u3cNGP61Oq3tWYp6V_F-5jb5L2iHb) Course is great if you can dedicate time.
2. [Data Structures Made Easy:Thinking with Python by Narsimha Karumanchi](https://www.pdfdrive.com/data-structure-and-algorithmic-thinking-with-python-data-structure-and-algorithmic-puzzles-e158071362.html): The book is a must for beginner to advanced concepts. the interview process for the profile for an SDE becomes a cakewalk once someone is thorough with this book's concepts.


### With C/C++
1. If you are an absolute beginner and struggling to develop basic programming aptitude and logical thinking, then [this](https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCkGS_3D0HEzfflFnG0bD24A) is probably the best place for you. Feel free to learn in Hinglish.
2. I found this [course](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=92S4zgXN17o&list=PL2_aWCzGMAwI3W_JlcBbtYTwiQSsOTa6P) useful. 
3. Launched as an interview prep course, the [Apni Kaksha Channel](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ulxP_9kqI8U&list=PLKKfKV1b9e8qBh_LG02V8R8qGRQjloeBj) is probably one of the best C++ beginner to advanced course launched by NSUT grads working in the tech industry.
4.  [Data Structures Made Easy by Narsimha Karumanchi](https://www.pdfdrive.com/data-structures-and-algorithms-made-easy-data-structures-and-algorithmic-puzzles-e158226594.html): The book is a must for beginner to advanced concepts. the interview process for the profile for an SDE becomes a cakewalk once someone is thorough with this book's concepts.

## Machine Learning AI NLP
1. To get started with Machine Learning first course you need to do is [this](https://www.coursera.org/learn/machine-learning).
Complete the assignments for maximum outcome from this course.
2. For Mathematics and Statistics, Youtube Channel like [Mathematical Monk](https://www.youtube.com/user/mathematicalmonk) can be preferred.
3. For understanding [Linear Algebra : Essence of Linear Algebra](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kjBOesZCoqc&list=PL0-GT3co4r2y2YErbmuJw2L5tW4Ew2O5B) and how [Neural Networks](https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLZHQObOWTQDNU6R1_67000Dx_ZCJB-3pi) and [Differntial Equations :  Essence of Calculus](https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLZHQObOWTQDMsr9K-rj53DwVRMYO3t5Yr) try these playlists. Channel [3 Blue 1 Brown](https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCYO_jab_esuFRV4b17AJtAw) gives good visual animations to understand these concepts easily.
4. For specialization in Machine Learning and Deep Learning complete all these [Course](https://www.coursera.org/specializations/deep-learning) in specialization pragramme with assignments.

6. [Krish Naik](https://www.youtube.com/results?search_query=krish+naik): Apart from his tutorials on various ml,ai and data science concepts, his introductory videos are a treat for the beginners as they include best online resources(free and paid ones) for learning several field concepts, system configs required, interview questions and interactive sessions involving his path to data science etc.
7. At last for learning more and more daily try reading as much research papers as possible.

### Data analytics
1. Before going into the topics of Data Analytics one needs to clear the basics of Statistics. To brush up that here is a [playlist](https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLlz0muypSBNYknvzMnyQd37CFEzpVXQGZ) to help you out.
2. Once you're done with the basic of statistics, you need to install a few pip files to get started with Data Analytics on Python. Given below are the necessary pip files you need to install.
3. Pandas: Pandas is an open source tool for Python, which helps in Data Structures and Data Analysis. To install Pandas you need to do [this](https://pandas.pydata.org/)
4. The next Important tool is installing MatPlotLib. MatPlotLib is another open source library that allows you to generate plots, histograms, bar charts, scatterplots, box plots, etc. To install matplotlib do [this](https://matplotlib.org/users/installing.html).
5. While most of the IDEs come with NumPy already installed if you have any problem with NumPy do [this](https://www.scipy.org/install.html)
6. Once you have set up all the necessary files, you can start with the below tutorials:
[Pandas Tutorial](https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLeo1K3hjS3uuASpe-1LjfG5f14Bnozjwy)
[Data Analysis with Pandas](https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLQVvvaa0QuDc-3szzjeP6N6b0aDrrKyL-)
[MatPlotLib Tutorial](https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLQVvvaa0QuDfefDfXb9Yf0la1fPDKluPF)
You can also look at this course from [Coursera](https://www.coursera.org/learn/data-analysis-with-python)

## App Development
### React Native
First learn basic [JavaScript](#basic-needed-for-all) and also [ES6 Syntax](#basic-level-2). All core concepts like JSX, Redux is same for [React](#react) and React Native.

1. [Get Started with official tutorial](https://facebook.github.io/react-native/docs/getting-started)
2. [Get Started with Videos](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EMoXvr0Q9LE&list=PLYxzS__5yYQlHANFLwcsSzt3elIbYTG1h)

React Native can be frustrating while installing, I will highly recommend starting with **Expo**, which is under the tab `Expo CLI Quickstart` on page [Getting Started](https://facebook.github.io/react-native/docs/getting-started).

Read [why not expo](https://docs.expo.io/versions/v32.0.0/introduction/why-not-expo/) and if you feel so then use `React Native CLI`. Installation is given on tab `React Native CLI Quickstart`. **Follow the installation step by step and line by line**, do not skip or do anything else other than what is given, even do not try to mess with versions, just do what is said.  

React Native is not self-sufficient, it needs more modules for little advanced uses.
1. [Redux](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=np8A_aW7Pew)
2. [React Native with Redux](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KcC8KZ_Ga2M&list=PLy9JCsy2u97m3nSbw0xzo-X4EEoZiikd8)
3. [React Navigation V2](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eUIq0vzDdJQ&list=PLy9JCsy2u97nn0Yrf3ioMbRL7guVlzk9d)
4. [React Navigation V3](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MePfTc_PgzQ&list=PLy9JCsy2u97kiHGp2USF5SKAfz93WwLuh): First see V2 then jump to this
5. [Axios](https://github.com/axios/axios): Although this has nothing to do with react but is very frequently used.

## Technologies and Languages


### Java 
[Apni Kaksha](https://www.youtube.com/results?search_query=apni+kaksha)
[Java Udemy Course](https://www.udemy.com/course/java-the-complete-java-developer-course/)
[Java Projects](https://www.udemy.com/course/selenium-training/)
[Java In depth all levels](https://www.udemy.com/course/java-in-depth-become-a-complete-java-engineer/)
### Git and GitHub
[This Udacity course is great](https://classroom.udacity.com/courses/ud775)
### Python
1. [W3Schools](https://www.w3schools.com/python/default.asp)
2. [Udemy Course](https://www.udemy.com/share/1000dOAEYceF9SQHQ=/): This course is best that I could find, but is lengthy. I recommend this to all level of students, beginners to advanced.
3.[Learn Python with Corey Schafer](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=k9TUPpGqYTo&list=PL-osiE80TeTt2d9bfVyTiXJA-UTHn6WwU) This is indeed the best python course available for free online. The playlist includes general OOPs concepts, setting up the IDE and moves onto specific libraries including matplotlib(), image processing using pillow and django tutorials.
### Ruby
- [The Odin Project](https://www.theodinproject.com/courses/ruby-programming): This is probably the best Ruby course there is. It teaches Ruby using the concept of learning by doing (which, in my opinion, is the best way yo learn programming), i.e. you learn concepts by building projects using what you just learnt.

### Swift
Swift is the newest programming language and is easy to understand if you have basic concepts like Arrays and Function etc. Get Started with [Apple's Guided Tour](https://docs.swift.org/swift-book/GuidedTour/GuidedTour.html).
### PHP
See [W3School's Tutorial](https://www.w3schools.com/php7/default.asp)

### JAVA
Top Websites for getting started
- [Tutorialspoint](https://www.tutorialspoint.com/java/index.htm)
- [W3School's](https://www.w3schools.com/java/)
